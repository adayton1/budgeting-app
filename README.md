budgeting-app
=============
Idea:
Tracking a budget in a spreadsheet has never worked for me. First of all, it’s not accessible enough and it’s not easy to adjust. I want to create a web and eventually a mobile app that allows people to build/adjust a custom budget, and be able to record income/expenses on the go. The target audience is individuals and families as opposed to businesses, so it should be simple and easy to use.

Architecture:

MEAN stack

Possibly use MySQL instead of MongoDB after we determine how to store the data and the operations to be performed on the data.
